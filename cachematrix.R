## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## Create two functions
     ## 1. makeCacheMatrix
          ## - creates a special matrix object that caches the inverse
     ## 2. cacheSolve
          ## - computes the inverse of the matrix returned by 
          ## makeCacheMatrix. If already calculated then  
          ## retrieve inverse from cache

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}
##edit

## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
